# Disintegrated Development Environment

STOP PUTTING EVERYTHING INSIDE NEOVIM

neovim is a ~~bad~~ mediocre operating system. it is a ~~bad~~ mediocre window manager. it is a ~~bad~~ mediocre gui library. it is a ~~bad~~ mediocre terminal.

Use your operating systems window manager (if you dont use a TWM thats on you)

Use a real terminal (kitty and wezterm, among others, have the scripting and remote control needed to replace whatever you need from the inbuilt terminal)

Use a real git gui/tui (it just needs to open files with nvim)

Use flatten.nvim (or some other lighter remote open plugin)

**Use the shell**
